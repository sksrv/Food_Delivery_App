# 🍕 Tomato — Food Delivery (Personal Implementation by SKSRV)

This repository is my **personal implementation and learning version** of the original [Mshandev/Food-Delivery](https://github.com/Mshandev/Food-Delivery) project.  
I customized and explored it to understand the **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** stack and how a complete food delivery system works end-to-end.

---

## 🚀 Overview
Tomato is a full-featured food ordering web application built using the **MERN stack**, providing both **user** and **admin** panels for smooth, secure online food ordering.  
It includes authentication, payment integration, and order management functionality.

---

## 🔧 What I Did
- Forked and set up the project locally to explore full-stack architecture.
- Enhanced README documentation for setup and learning clarity.
- Made minor UI updates and branding changes in the frontend.
- Deployed test version locally to understand deployment and API integration.

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
Working on this project helped me:
- Understand full-stack flow using React, Node, Express, and MongoDB.
- Implement JWT authentication and API security.
- Learn about Stripe payment gateway integration.
- Explore role-based access and REST API structure.
